Make a dome together, the dome has to be up by Thursday around lunch time.

[See week schedule here in this google document](https://goo.gl/SNCe5N).

Think of it as a planetarium, a 360 degree screen to do projections of 360 content.

The dome has two distinct parts:
1. The geodesic structure (the things made out of sticks)
2. The hemispherical screen (the textile screen that hangs from it)

# Geodesic dome structure
- Based on the work that american designer Buckminster Fuller did in 1945.
- The polyhedral lattice forms a hemisphere (one half of a sphere, 5/8's to be precise)
- The struts form a lattice very much like the one that Carbon atoms form when they bond together (what material does carbon make when it forms a regular lattice?)
- It has many wonderful properties:
    - it distributes stress evenly across the entire structure
    - it's pretty solid
    - it can withstand very heavy loads for its size
    - it is very easy to build (it is built out of hollow tubing, the calculations normally result in 3 lengths out of which the entire structure is built)
    - can be made out of many different materials (metal, pvc, wood, etc.)
    - geodeseic domes have strong counter-cultural connotations: in the 60s many people built geodesic domes as a way to create cheap housing and it is a favorite of hippies the world over
    - never out of fashion, it seems
    - seen at festivals for 360 experiences, etc.

- The one we will be building is called a Zip-Tie Dome and if you google for it you can learn more about this particular build.
        - Nodes (joints), see prototypes
        - We need to make these elements: 3-types of struts and 3-types of nodes

- Activities: cutting with a saw, labelling tubes, drilling tubes

Marcus will be kickstarting this team, we will need about 4/5 people.
There's a PDF with a build plan that you can get from Marcus.

*GOAL FOR THE DAY: HAVE ALL THE MATERIALS CUT TO SIZE, CORRECTLY LABELLED & DRILLED*

---------------------------

# Hemispherical screen

- Our hemispherical screen will be our projection surface for 360 content.
- It will be made out of light-tight polyester, it is fairly crafty work, so a lot of attention to detail will be needed.
- The screen is composed of 13 gores, these are 13 pieces of textile that have a very specific shape. The cut needs to be precise

- Activities: 
    - 1st -> making the pattern out of paper
    - 2nd -> cutting 13 textile gores to size (and marking correct side of textile)
    - 3rd -> sewing gore pairs together

I will be kickstarting this team. (3/4 ppl to make pattern, 2 ppl to cut, 2 ppl to sew)

*GOALs FOR THE DAY:* 
- *MAKE THE GORE PATTERN OUT OF PAPER*
- *CUT ALL 13 GORES TO SIZE*
- *SEW PAIRS OF GORES TOGETHER*

---------------------------

# Projection team

5 ppl (2 for rig, 3 for projection mapping experiments)

- Your job will be to:
    - build the mirror projection rig
    - test the projection and how to align it with the dome (see Bourke's pattern)
    - experiment with different softwares to map the projection to the dome

*GOALS FOR THE DAY:*
    - *MAKE A SIMPLE RIG FOR THE BEAMER + MIRROR*
    - *CREATE A CALIBRATION PATTERN*
    - *HAVE ONE METHOD TO SHOW 360 PICTURES, ONE METHOD TO SHOW 360 VIDEO, ONE METHOD TO HAVE 3D CONTENT*

Sander, can you help? (Processing + Syphon)
Team can start by reading the materials in the USB stick and googling for things.
I will join them after lunch to kickstart the experiments.

---------------------------

# Content

For the content we will do a simple assignment, just keep it in mind through the duration of the week: "create a piece of 360 content that captures your experience of this retreat" (you can make photos, videos or 3D models)

Vera, Bambi, Genevieve? can you help with showing the new students the photogrammetry technique?

---------------------------
## Lunch is at 12.30pm, dinner is at 7pm.

# TIPS FOR THIS SPRINT

1. Production must be running **AT ALL TIMES**, if you want to take a break, change task, or go for a walk, **DO NOT STOP YOUR ACTIVITY UNTIL you have taught another person how to do it**, and you have made sure that they **DO IT WELL** and they take it over from you.
2. Before you take over a job, **TEST YOUR HAND BY USING A PIECE OF SCRAP MATERIAL FIRST!** And do not move to the real deal until you can do the job with some confidence. 
3. If you cannot attain confidence at a task after trying a few scraps, let others know, maybe you cannot take over yet.
4. If you find yourself with nothing to do, approach others, watch them do what they do. Observe. Learn. Ask. Talk to them.
5. **The quality of your job as an individual will determine the quality of the whole.**
5. Be autonomous! If you find yourself depending on another person all the time, ask yourself why... maybe there are other things that you can do that are a better fit for you at that moment.
6. **You will come across unplanned challenges... work as a team, be creative.**
7. We will do one stand-up after breakfast,and one before dinner. (we can do one after lunch if nedded)
8. If you identify a need, something missing? Write it down in the sheet for the next shopping round.
9. If you can't do your job because you are waiting for something, you are obstructed by something. Do not keep it to yourself, bring it up immediately or if everyone is busy wait for the next stand-up to let everybody know.
10. Work **MUST CONTINUE** until the goals for the day are completed!
11. Remember to take breaks, go for a walk now and then. Drink water and eat well.
12. AND ABOVE ALL HAVE FUN!
